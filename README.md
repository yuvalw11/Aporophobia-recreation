This repository contains code and results of the replication of the experiments in *Can Poverty Be
Reduced by Acting on Discrimination? An Agent-based Model for Policy Making* by Aguilera et al.,
published in AAMAS 2024

It contains code from the paper's
[official repository](https://github.com/albaaguilera/Aporophobia), with a few required fixes. The
local results are presented in the [recreation.ipynb](Results/recreation.ipynb) notebook.
